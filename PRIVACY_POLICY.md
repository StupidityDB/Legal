## Automated Decision-Making

We engage in automated decision-making to enforce our terms of service and maintain the integrity of our platform. This includes automated bans based on our set of rules, which are triggered by the content of reviews submitted by users or via automated detection.

- Obtain human intervention in the decision-making process.
- Express their point of view regarding a decision made by automated means.
- Contest any decision resulting from automated decision-making that they believe is incorrect.
- Request information about the logic involved in the automated decision-making process and the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing.

**Review and Appeal:** Users affected by an automated ban can appeal the decision. Upon appeal, a human review will be conducted to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the automated decision. We will provide a clear and accessible process for users to challenge automated decisions and seek redress.
